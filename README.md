##Set Up Instructions
1. GETTING THE FILES:

	a. Download and Pokewatch.zip and extract files (https://db.tt/6xC2eLL7).
	
	b. Alternatively, clone and build the repo.
	
2. CREATING POKEMONGO ACCOUNTS:

	Only one user account is needed for each bot, but creating both a PTC account
	and a google account will allow the bot to function if either sign in system goes offline.
	YOU SHOULD NOT USE YOUR PERSONAL ACCOUNT
	
	a. Create a Gmail account for the bot (https://accounts.google.com/signup)
	
	b. Create a PTC account for the bot (https://club.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-trainer-club/sign-up/)
	
	c. You will need the username and password for both acccounts later.
	
3. CREATING TWITTER ACCOUNT:

	If you want to tweet from a personal/existing twitter account, skip part a.
	
	a. Create a twitter account for the bot (https://twitter.com/signup)
	
	b. Create a new twitter application while signed in as the bot's account (https://apps.twitter.com/app/new)
	
	c. You will need the Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, and Accesss Secret from the application's
	   management page, under the Keys and Access Tokens tab
	   
4. SETTING UP THE BOT (Step 4 can be greatly simplified using the ConfigurationGenerator described below.):

	a. Open Configuration.json
	
	b. For each PoGoAccount you are using, set PTCUsername and PTCPassword to your PTC account credentials if you created one.
	
	c. For each PoGoAccount you are using, set GAUsername and GAPassword to your Google account credentials if you created one.
	
	d. Set TwitterConsumerToken to your twitter app's Consumer Key, TwitterConsumerSecret to Consumer Secret, TwitterAccessToken to Access Token and TwitterAccessSecret to Access Secret
	   
5. CUSTOMIZE BOT FUNCTIONALITY (Step 5 can be greatly simplified using the ConfigurationGenerator described below.):

	You can change the following fields to customize the functionality of your app:
	
	MinimumLifeExpectancy: Minimum ammount of time that a pokemon can have before despawning that you still want
		to tweet about, in seconds. (so you only tweet about pokemon that will be around long enough to catch)
		
	RateLimit: Minimum ammount of time in seconds between tweets for an individual region.
	
	ExcludedPokemon: Pokedex ids for common pokemon that you want to ignore.
	
	PriorityPokemon: Pokedex ids for extremely rare pokemon that will be tweeted with an emphasis and will ignore any rate limits.
	
	Pokevision: [true or false] Replace google maps link with Pokevision link. (Not Recommended, especially since Pokevision is now dead.)
	
	TagPokemon: [true or false] Should a hashtag for the found pokemon be included.
	
	TagRegion: [true or false] Should a hashtag for the region be included.
	
	CustomTags: A list of extra hashtags to include.
	
	PokemonOverrides: A mapping from pokedex id to a string that should be displayed in place of that pokemon's english name.
	
	RegularTweet: A recipe for the tweet to send out when a pokemon is found. If you are unfamiliar with string formatting,
	be careful, messing up the syntax will cause your bot to crash.
	
		{0}: Name of pokemon found
		
		{1}: Prefix for region where pokemon was found.
		
		{2}: Name of region where pokemon was found.
		
		{3}: Suffix for region where pokemon was found.
		
		{4}: Time that found pokemon will expire.
		
		{5}: Link to google maps
		
	PriorityTweet: Same as regular tweet, but will be used when a pokemon included in PriorityPokemon is found.
	
	Regions: Areas to be searched by the bot. Each region consists of a name, prefix, suffix, and a list of locations.
	
		Name: Human friendly display name that describes the general area of the listed locations
		
		Prefix: Text to make the Name make sense in the context of a sentence
		
		Suffix: Same as prefix, but after the Name
		
		Locations: List of GPS coordinates that the bot will scan for pokemon in. The bot will identify pokemon within
			~70 meters of that point. Consider using the LocationGenerator to get coordinates.
		
		Exclusions: Pokedex ids for pokemon that you want to ignore specifically in this region (In addition to the general ExcludedPokemon field).
		
		Inclusions: Pokedex ids for pokemon that you specifically do not want to ignore in the region (Overrides the general ExcludedPokemon field).
		
6. ENABLE REBOOTING

	PokewatchLauncher.exe will restart pokewatch any time it dies in the middle of running (usually due to server outages). By default on most machines, OS will prompt you to acknowlege the crash before PokewatchLauncher can reset the application, to disable this and allow the app to run indefinitely without supervision, follow this guide: https://www.raymond.cc/blog/disable-program-has-stopped-working-error-dialog-in-windows-server-2008/
	
7. ACCEPTING TOS:

	PokemonGo accounts cannot be used without having first accepted the PokemonGo terms of service. Once your Configuration.json is set up, you should be able to run PokeTos.exe to accept the terms of service for all of your Pokewatch accounts. This program intentionally runs slowly, give it a few seconds.
	
8. RUNNING THE APP:

	Run PokewatchLauncher.exe
	
9. OPTIONAL:

	a. Due to limitations with the PokemonGo API, any given PokemonGo user can only update their location every 10 seconds,
	   therefore, it is not recommended to include more than 50 Locations to scan on a single bot.
	   Each location has a radius of 70m.
	   With more locations, it will on average take longer to find pokemon after they spawn.
	   The faster they are found and tweeted, the more time people have to find and catch them.
	   If you want to scan more locations, you should repeat this process for multiple bots, with different GPS locations, but reuse the credentials from Step 3.
           
           
###Configuration Generator (Created By RedSparr0w)

The location generator is a tool that will allow you to place points on the map and get a json array of coordinates added to your clipboard. To use it, simply open ConfigurationGenerator.html in a browser.

Map: After you have created areas to scan, right click the map to place a point and associate it with an area. You can also drag boxes to create coverage areas and have points automatically generated. Right click a point to remove it. Click and drag on a point to move it. Points from different regions should not overlap or duplicate pokemon may be tweeted.

Pokemon GO Accounts: Under this tab, you can enter the login information for the accounts you will be using to scan.

Twitter Account: Under this tab, you can enter your Twitter Oauth tokens.

Areas: Under this tab, you can create the regions that Pokewatch will monitor, and handle their display prefix/suffixes.

Tweets: Under this tab, you can customize your twitter messages and preview the results. You can also specify a rate limit for your tweets, add additional hashtags, and turn the generated hashtags on/off.

Other: Under this tab, you can tweak the spacing between points for the mass marking functionality to remove gaps. The optimal location for this slider will vary from place to place. 

There are a few customization fields that the Configuration Generator does not currently support, you will need to change these in the Configuration.json file by hand: Region Inclusions, Region Exclusions, Pokevision, ExcludedPokemon, PriorityPokemon, MinimumLifeExpectancy, and PokmonOverrides.

Once you have everything set up, click Generate Configuration to get the Configuration.json file. You can also load from a Configuration.json file that you've already made by clicking the Load Configuration btton.

If the location service in your browser is disabled,  LocationGenerator will load a default location every time it is refreshed. If you plan on opening this a lot, consider changing the GPS coordinates on line 37 to something more convenient for you.
